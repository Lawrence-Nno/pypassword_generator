#### _This python script generates a random password, the length of the password depends on the input it received_

Pypassword generator is a fun project I coded when I was learning python. I decided to publish some of my earlier codes during my python journey. Hence this!
_**Edit!!**_ I now have a much better standalone GUI password generator app, but that will be uploaded much later.

## Tech
- [Python] - This script requires only python to run

## Usage
- This python script/mini project generates a random secure password for you to use on your online accounts.
- You can use it for your emails, social media accounts, or anywhere a password is required basically. The days of weak passwords are long gone.
